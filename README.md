# LLM and Multi-Agent Collaboration for Demand Response
In this project, we leverage the multi-agent framework 'AutoGen' to create AI agents representing various stakeholders engaged in demand response, including operational, market, and consumer interests. These agents collaborate to formulate proposed solutions that align with the collective interests of all stakeholders and user preferences.


Demand response is a strategy that involves adjusting electricity usage in response to supply conditions or price signals to maintain grid stability and manage energy consumption.
